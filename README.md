# Socket.io v1.x library for Particle IOT devices

Works, but is work in progress. 

Upcoming: 
- The different api calls will be debugged or added if not present yet.
- it will be packaged neater, with a working example and stuff. 

Tested on Photon only, but I don't see why it would not work on any other Particle device. 


Feedback and even better: pull requests welcome.
